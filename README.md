The [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai) **cuSignal** project leverages [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy), [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), and the RAPIDS ecosystem for GPU accelerated signal processing. In some cases, cuSignal is a direct port of [Scipy Signal](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/master/scipy/signal) to leverage GPU compute resources via CuPy but also contains Numba CUDA kernels for additional speedups for selected functions. cuSignal achieves its best gains on large signals and compute intensive functions but stresses online processing with zero-copy memory (pinned, mapped) between CPU and GPU.

**NOTE:** For the latest stable [README.md](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal/blob/master/README.md) ensure you are on the `master` branch.

## Quick Start
cuSignal has an API that mimics SciPy Signal. In depth functionality is displayed in the [notebooks](https://github.com/rapidsai/cusignal/blob/master/notebooks) section of the repo, but let's examine the workflow for **Polyphase Resampling** under multiple scenarios:

**Scipy Signal (CPU)**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import signal

start = 0
stop = 10
num_samps = int(1e8)
resample_up = 2
resample_down = 3

cx = np.linspace(start, stop, num_samps, endpoint=False) 
cy = np.cos(-cx**2/6.0)

cf = signal.resample_poly(cy, resample_up, resample_down, window=('kaiser', 0.5))
```
This code executes on 2x Xeon E5-2600 in 2.36 sec.

**cuSignal with Data Generated on the GPU with CuPy**
```python
import cupy as cp
import cusignal

start = 0
stop = 10
num_samps = int(1e8)
resample_up = 2
resample_down = 3

gx = cp.linspace(start, stop, num_samps, endpoint=False) 
gy = cp.cos(-gx**2/6.0)

gf = cusignal.resample_poly(gy, resample_up, resample_down, window=('kaiser', 0.5))
```
This code executes on an NVIDIA P100 in 258 ms.

**cuSignal with Data Generated on the CPU with Mapped, Pinned (zero-copy) Memory**
```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
import cusignal

start = 0
stop = 10
num_samps = int(1e8)
resample_up = 2
resample_down = 3

# Generate Data on CPU
cx = np.linspace(start, stop, num_samps, endpoint=False) 
cy = np.cos(-cx**2/6.0)

# Create shared memory between CPU and GPU and load with CPU signal (cy)
gpu_signal = cusignal.get_shared_mem(num_samps, dtype=np.complex128)
gpu_signal[:] = cy

gf = cusignal.resample_poly(gpu_signal, resample_up, resample_down, window=('kaiser', 0.5))
```
This code executes on an NVIDIA P100 in 154 ms.

**cuSignal with Data Generated on the CPU and Copied to GPU [AVOID THIS FOR ONLINE SIGNAL PROCESSING]**
```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
import cusignal

start = 0
stop = 10
num_samps = int(1e8)
resample_up = 2
resample_down = 3

# Generate Data on CPU
cx = np.linspace(start, stop, num_samps, endpoint=False) 
cy = np.cos(-cx**2/6.0)

gf = cusignal.resample_poly(cp.asarray(cy), resample_up, resample_down, window=('kaiser', 0.5))
```
This code executes on an NVIDIA P100 in 728 ms.

## Dependencies
* NVIDIA GPU (Maxwell or Newer)
* CUDA Divers
* Anaconda/Miniconda (3.7 version)
* CuPy >= 6.2.0
* Optional: RTL-SDR or other SDR Driver/Packaging. Find more information and follow the instructions for setup [here](https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr). NOTE: [pyrtlsdr](https://github.com/roger-/pyrtlsdr) is not automatically installed with the default cusignal environment. To make use of some of the examples in the Notebooks, you'll need to buy/install an rtl-sdr and necessary software packages.

## Install cuSignal

### Download and install Andaconda then create conda environment. 
`conda env create -f cusignal_conda_env.yml`

### Activate conda environment

`conda activate cusignal`

### Install cuSignal module

`python setup.py install`

### Once installed, periodically update environment

`conda env update -f cusignal_conda_env.yml`

### Also, confirm unit testing via PyTest

`pytest -v` for verbose mode with `pytest -v -k <function name>` for more select testing
